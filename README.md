## Founder & Systems Architect at CLogic
<img src="CLogic_Logo_2.svg" width="250" alt="CLogic · Code Meets Logic">

I’ve been building in Unity since 2017, mainly on systems, tooling and designing architecture that doesn’t collapse six months later.
I prefer working close to foundations to ensure that projects can scale

My work is about shared systems, workflow discipline, and bringing structure to projects that need stability.
