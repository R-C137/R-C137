## Hi there 👋

I'm **Shaun**, a **self-taught Unity programmer** with **7+ years of experience**. I love tackling on challenges, creating complex solutions, and bringing ideas to life.

I specialize in **freelance Unity development**, mostly on **back-end systems**, but I can work effective with UI and front-end systems. I’m always looking for new and exciting projects to collaborate on.

### 🔭 Currently Working On
- [C's Utils](https://github.com/R-C137/CsUtils): A Unity library providing QOL additions to developers.
- [Dead-Match](https://www.instagram.com/deeadmatch/): A strategic card-based game where players attempt to take over objectives using the undead.
- The Dealer's Voice: A visual novel like card game
- My own website: Coming Soon

### 🤝 Let’s Collaborate
- Have a Unity project in mind? Let’s build it together!
- Open to partnering on single-player 3D projects but also open to 2D and multiplayer projects.
